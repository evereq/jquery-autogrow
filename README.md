# Auto Growing Textareas  

If you have a textarea, as the user types it will expand vertically to accommodate the size of the entry.  

Changes:  

- New event 'autogrow:updated' was added to be able to trigger update of textarea size if content was changed manually from JS code after autogrow plugin was initialized.
